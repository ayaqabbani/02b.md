# the A.C.P
the ACP is some commands that we consider as a cycle, we run after doing any change to the cloned repository.

## the A stands for add 
the commmand git Add adds changes in the working directory to the staging area, and it tells the git that you want to update to a certain file but it won't be saved unless you go to the next step.

## the C stands for commit
this command runs into your edited repo and find the changes that you did and then it requires you to add a prief reason of why you did this change, but we're not done yet!. you have to go to the next and final step to finish your work.

## the P stands for push
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. and here you'll be asked for your password for the final touch, and before you know it your repo will be edited and uploaded.
