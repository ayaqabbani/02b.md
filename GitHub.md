# what is GitHub ?
 GitHub is an open source code management system to make software builds faster, it contains the Git that we've summarized earlier to help with the editing, but for the final view all the files or repositories will be saved and reached through the GitHub, so basically its the cloud that we save our work on.

 # GitHub accounts
 you have to create an account to save your work on, follow some great developers to get inspired or even your colleagues so you can access their latest work.

 # social networking 
 The social networking aspect of GitHub is probably its most powerful feature, allowing projects to grow more than just about any of the other features offered. Each user on GitHub has their own profile that acts like a resume of sorts, showing your past work and contributions to other projects via pull requests.

# GitHub isn't just for developers
you can also use GitHub for any types of files. If you have a team that is constantly making changes to a word document, for example,  you could use GitHub as your version control system, and as we said earlier its also a back up cloud for your work.
